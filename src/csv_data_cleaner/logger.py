"""Centralized logging setup for csv-data-cleaner.

Following standard library-logging practice, this module does not
configure handlers, formatters, or levels on import -- that decision
belongs to the consuming application (or the CLI's ``--verbose`` flag),
not the library. A :class:`logging.NullHandler` is attached to the
package logger so that, absent any configuration, the library stays
silent instead of triggering Python's "No handlers could be found"
warning.

Library modules should call :func:`get_logger` rather than using
``print`` or the root logger directly.
